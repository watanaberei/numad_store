This excites us because it allows us to explore new trends and revisit classic ones through our service, products, music, and merchandise. For the past years, we’ve been blessed to work directly with farmers from Jeju Island as well as one of the oldest furniture makers in Korea to source and manufacture our in-store goods. We choose to invest extra time and money in these areas in order to share a taste of our roots with our expanding community.","about_this_biz_role":null,"about_this_biz_specialties":"Specialty coffee and bakery looking share delicious offerings with high attention to quality\nand details.","about_this_biz_year_established":"2020","alcohol":null,"ambience":null,"bike_parking":null,"business_accepts_android_pay":null,"business_accepts_apple_pay":null,"business_accepts_credit_cards":null,"business_parking":{"valet":false,"garage":null,"street":true,"lot":true,"validated":false},"caters":null,"dogs_allowed":true,"good_for_kids":null,"good_for_meal":null,"good_for_working":null,"happy_hour":null,"has_tv":null,"menu_url":null,"noise_level":"average","open24_hours":null,"platform_delivery":null,"restaurants_delivery":null,"restaurants_good_for_groups":true,"restaurants_reservations":null,"restaurants_table_service":null,"restaurants_take_out":true,"service_locations_biz_dict":null,"waitlist_reservation":null,"wi_fi":"free","liked_by_vegans":null,"outdoor_seating":true,"has_gluten_free":null,"liked_by_vegetarians":null,"hot_and_new":null}}],"total":162,"region":{"center":{"longitude":-117.923,"latitude":33.87442}}},"expires":1741506501580}
