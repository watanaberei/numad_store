the early 2000s, in Oakland, California, a slightly disaffected freelance musician and coffee lunatic, weary of the commercial coffee enterprise and stale, overly roasted beans, decided to open a roaster for people who were clamoring for the actual taste of fresh coffee. Using a minuscule six-pound batch roaster, he made a historic vow: \"I will only sell coffee less than 48 hours out of the roaster to my guests, so they may enjoy coffee at peak flavor. I will only use the finest, most delicious, and responsibly sourced beans.\"He named his business Blue Bottle Coffee and began another chapter in the history of superlative coffee.Now, nearly 15 years later, and thanks to the enthusiastic support of many loyal guests, Blue Bottle Coffee has grown to a small network of cafes, an espresso cart, the occasional pop-up, and a small fleet of Loring roasters. We are still united by the simple purpose of getting great coffee to everyone who asks for it.","about_this_biz_specialties":"We started our company with a vow insisting that we would only sell coffee within 48 hours of roasting. Coffee doesn't necessarily taste best within 48 hours, but we wanted to get our coffee into your hands quickly, so you could enjoy the ascent to peak flavor.Flavor in coffee is a crescendo--no part of the journey is boring.In our cafes, we fanatically taste each coffee to determine the precise days on which it will achieve peak flavor. Hayes Valley Espresso, for instance, really sings on days 4-7.We're now applying this precision to our whole beans, so you can experience our coffee at the absolute summit of deliciousness.","bike_parking":true,"business_accepts_credit_cards":true,"business_parking":{"garage":false,"street":true,"validated":false,"lot":true,"valet":false},"caters":false,"dogs_allowed":false,"noise_level":"average","restaurants_delivery":true,"restaurants_take_out":true,"wi_fi":"no"},"transactions":["delivery"],"messaging":{"response_rate":null,"response_time":null}},"expires":1739710118092}
